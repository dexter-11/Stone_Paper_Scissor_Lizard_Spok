# Stone Paper Scissor Lizard Spok

### This is the game popularized by non other than **Sheldon Cooper** from the popular TV sitcom _'The Big Bang Theory'_.

As Sheldon explains, 
```
"Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, 
Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, 
Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
```

An extended version of stone paper scissor. Being worked upon as of now to bring to you a Live GUI version of the game.
When you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock-Paper-Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well,so this is a slight variation that reduces that probability.
